# GPT Autopilot

I wanted to use my own OpenAI API Key instead of paying every month for ChatGPT. I also wanted to make use of the various tools that OpenAI keeps releasing.

From there came the idea of this autopilot.

I was learning expo at the time, and I thought it might be a good time to use what little knowledge I had and gather even more knowledge, by trying to build an usable app where I can forget about all my problems by talking to a non-human, but human-like AI.

My plan is to use this to learn more about TypeScript, React, and building user facing software that can handle basic user requests.

I plan to build the following features eventually in the app:
- [ ] General chat with GPT model (after choosing which model to use),
- [ ] Define and use `Assistants` and use them for specific tasks (Click [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview "Assistants Overview") to learn more about assistants),
- [ ] Image generation using models like `DALL.E`,
- [ ] Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text capabilities,
- [ ] Analyzing uploaded images and describe it to the user,
- [ ] Uploading various files (png, jpg, csv, xlsx, docx etc) in the chat (this is currently supported in ChatGPT, but I have not seen this in the tools that use the API Key)
- [ ] Moderation of the chats can also be added later on.

All the best to me, I'm not sure how much time I will get to work on this, given that I am also finishing up with my graduation and looking for a job. But hopefully soon it will be usable! ðŸ¤ž
